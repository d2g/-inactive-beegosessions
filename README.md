beegosessions
=============

Just the sessions package from beego, refactored (i.e. I no longer need the redis driver to use the memory version)

This is just a refactored repository to allow the inclusinon of Beego Sessions without requiring all the dependancies.

The Original Source, Licence etc can be found in the beego repo: https://github.com/astaxie/beego/tree/master/session
